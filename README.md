<h1>Stock Price Prediction using LSTM.</h1>

This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in Python. The dataset used for training and testing the model is obtained from Kaggle.

### Introduction
Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the complex and volatile nature of financial markets. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), has proven to be effective in capturing temporal dependencies and patterns in sequential data, making it a popular choice for stock price prediction.

This project aims to demonstrate how to implement an LSTM model in Python to predict stock prices. The code provided in this repository can serve as a starting point for your own stock price prediction projects or as a learning resource.
